## **🚀 Project Tasks**

### ❓ **Question 1 (Q1): Support Vector Machines (SVMs) on Iris Dataset**

#### **Tasks:**

-**Dataset Exploration:** Load the Iris dataset and provide details such as mean, variance and dimensions. Perform dimensionality reduction using t-SNE.
-**SVM Implementation:** Use SVM with linear kernel methods to classify the data. Visualize decision boundaries and confusion matrix.
-**Kernel Comparison:** Try with different kernels (10 degree polynomial kernels) and compare the results. Create a GIF showing the decision boundaries for each degree.
-**SVM from Scratch:** Implement the SVM algorithm without using libraries. Include methods for fitting, predicting, and using polynomial kernels. Compare the results with the scikit-learn implementation and provide a GIF of the decision boundaries.

### ❓ **Question 2 (Q3): Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Autoencoder Neural Network**

#### **Tasks:**

-**Network Architecture:** Provide a brief description of the network architecture used in the paper.
-**Model Implementation:** Implement the autoencoder model, ensuring it is trained to avoid overfitting. Use validation error to restore the best model weights.
-**Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model using confusion matrix, precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score. Discuss the suitability of these metrics for imbalanced datasets.
-**Threshold Analysis:** Analyze the effect of different thresholds on model performance and plot Recall & Accuracy graphs similar to figure 7 in the paper.
