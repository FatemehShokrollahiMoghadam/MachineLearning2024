## **🚀 Project Tasks**

### ❓ **Question 1 (Q1): Linear Classifiers Training**

#### **Tasks:**
- **Block Diagram Representation:** Train and evaluate a linear classifier. Provide a block diagram illustrating the process.
- **Dataset Generation:** Use `sklearn.datasets` to generate a dataset. Display the dataset's challenges.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use `sklearn.linear_model` to train a linear classifier and tune hyperparameters using gridsearch.
- **Decision Boundaries:** Visualize decision boundaries using `mlxtend`.
- **Make Data Using `drawdata`:** Repeat the process with different feature sets and class numbers using `drawdata`.

### ❓ **Question 2 (Q2): Fault Detection Dataset**

#### **Tasks:**
- **Data Preparation:** Download and preprocess the normal and faulty data, creating a labeled matrix.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extract features using methods listed in the project document.
- **Splitting Data:** Explain the importance of shuffling and split the data into training and evaluation sets.
- **Data Normalization:** Normalize the data using two methods.
- **Model Training:** Train a classifier from scratch.

### ❓ **Question 3 (Q3): Analyzing Weather Data and Implementing Regression Models**

#### **Tasks:**
- **Dataset Analysis:** Analyze the Weather in Seqed dataset, focusing on the relationship between `temperature` and `humidity`.
- **Model Implementation:** Implement RLS and LS models for temperature prediction. Compare the results.
- **Weighted Least Squares:** Implement and explain the WLS method.
